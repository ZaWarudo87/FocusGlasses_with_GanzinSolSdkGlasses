1. Install python (recommended version: 3.10 or newer)
2. Install all the modules (flask, flask_cors, opencv-python, numpy)
```bash
pip install flask flask_cors opencv-python numpy
```
3. Open `detect_object_backend.py`, and type your Sol SDK's IP in address (#line 54). Remember to save the file
4. Click `start.bat` and memorize your PC's IP

### Glasses Module

2. Install all the libraries (esp32:esp32@2.0.17, WebSockets@2.5.1, ArduinoJson@7.0.4, ESP8266 and ESP32 OLED driver for SSD1306 displays@4.6.1)
```bash
.\arduino-cli_windows config set directories.user ([System.String]::Concat([Environment]::GetFolderPath("MyDocuments"), "\Arduino"))
# .\arduino-cli_windows config set directories.user "C:\Users\user\Downloads\Arduino"
.\arduino-cli_windows core install esp32:esp32@2.0.17
.\arduino-cli_windows lib install WebSockets@2.5.1 ArduinoJson@7.0.4 "ESP8266 and ESP32 OLED driver for SSD1306 displays@4.6.1"
```
3. Open focus_glassees.ino with Arduino IDE and type your wifi name and password (#line 17, 18)
4. Type your PC's IP (#line 21, 95)
5. Upload your code on the ESP32 of your glasses module

## Operating Instructions
1. Put on your glasses module on Sol SDK
2. Start Sol SDK: just start it
3. Build the Backend: open start.bat
4. Start your glasses module and make sure your it connected to your wifi
5. If you want to acquire your learning status, you can enter your glasses module's IP and connect to the website

## Features
1. Determining the object type you're looking at. If you're looking at it over 10s, it will show you the object type
2. If your eyes "succade" over 20s, the glasses will ask you question to make sure that you feel ok

## A List of Known Bugs
Because of technical problems, we cannot judge what the users are exactly doing. The judging algorithm is measuring user's sight to decide whether the user is focuing on something.
So please use this program with honesty XD

## Troubleshooting Instructions

### Q1: Complie failure
> *A1: Make sure all the libraries you've included and your python version is new enough. * 
\-
### Q2: Having difficulty soldering your own glasses module
> *A2: Find a lovely little cat as your girlfriend so that she will help you <3 *
